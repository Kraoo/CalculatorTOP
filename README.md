## TheOdinProject - Calculator

# Overview
Really very basic for everything excpet the buttons, I decided to do all of it in JS with the 

    `var buttons = [
    'C', 'âˆš', '^', '%',
    '7', '8', '9', '/',
    '4', '5', '6', '*',
    '1', '2', '3', '-',
    '0', '.', '00', '+',
    '=' 
    ];` 

instead of adding all the buttons in HTML. And then I had to make classes for the specific buttons I wanted to style like the "=" button, I wanted it to be wider so I gave it a class and then styled it. I wanted to add more functions to this calculator but it was becoming too long so I opted for Square root, Exponent, and Percentage. I had a lot of fun styling this project, even though it's not the most creative I am very happy with this outcome.
